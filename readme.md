# DECtalk PC Windows NT DLL
This is a Win32 port of the 16-bit DECtalk PC DLL. In order to access hardware ports on NT, you will need [InpOut32](https://www.highrez.co.uk/Downloads/InpOut32).

## Notes
* This DLL has been successfully tested with a DECtalk PC2 installed in a Pentium II system running Windows 2000.
* Currently, the DLL can only load version 4.2 of the DECtalk software. This isn't surprising, considering this DLL was originally written in 1995, which was a year before DECtalk 4.2 was released. Hopefully, later software versions can be supported in the future.
* The documentation for the original DLL is included in this repository, however no attempt has been made to update it to reflect the changes in this NT port.
